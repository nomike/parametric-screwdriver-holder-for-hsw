This is a parametric screwdriver holder for honeycomb storage wall.

#### Usage

Measure the maximum diameter of the screwdriver shaft and the handle.
Then add them to the `arms` variable as a two-dimensional array.

To mount you will need one of those M3, M4, or M5 connectors from the original
[Honeycomb Storage Wall](https://www.printables.com/model/152592-honeycomb-storage-wall)
project by RostaP.

#### Issues

There seems to be an issue with OpenSCAD and thus the parameterization doesnÂ´t
properly work at the moment. So for the time being you need to change the
variables in the OpenSCAD file directly. The customizer within OpenSCAD won't
work.

This also means, that the gemerated example STL files are not correct.
